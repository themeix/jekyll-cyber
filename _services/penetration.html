               <h3 class="title">What is penetration testing?</h3>
               <p>Penetration testing, or pentesting, is a form of ethical cyber security assessment that seeks to
                  identify, safely exploit and help to remediate vulnerabilities across computer systems,
                  applications and websites. By utilising the same tools and techniques used by cyber adversaries,
                  pen testing replicates the conditions of a genuine attack.</p>
               <p>Commissioning a penetration test enables organisations to reduce security risk and provide
                  assurance into the security of their IT estates, by mitigating weaknesses before they can be
                  maliciously exploited.</p>

               <h3 class="title">Common security vulnerabilities</h3>
               <p>Some vulnerabilities just can’t be detected by automated software tools. By identifying and
                  exploiting vulnerabilities that evade automated online scanning assessments, and providing clear
                  help and advice to remediate issues, Redscan’s ethical hacking and security penetration testing
                  services enable you to understand and significantly reduce your organisation’s cyber security risk.
               </p>

               <p>Redscan is an award-winning provider of penetration testing services. Our range of CREST
                  penetration testing engagements help organisations to effectively manage cyber security risk by
                  identifying, safely exploiting, and helping to remediate vulnerabilities that could otherwise lead
                  to data and assets being compromised by malicious attackers. All our CREST pen testing engagements
                  are confidential and unlike real cyber-attacks, are designed to cause no damage or disruption. A
                  Redscan pentest will help identify vulnerabilities including: </p>
