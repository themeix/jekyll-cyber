               <h3 class="title">Introduction to VPNs</h3>
               <p>VPN stands for "Virtual Private Network" and describes the opportunity to establish a protected
                  network connection when using public networks. VPNs encrypt your internet traffic and disguise your
                  online identity. This makes it more difficult for third parties to track your activities online and
                  steal data. The encryption takes place in real time.</p>

               <h3 class="title">What are the benefits of a VPN connection?</h3>
               <p>A VPN connection disguises your data traffic online and protects it from external access. Unencrypted
                  data can be viewed by anyone who has network access and wants to see it. With a VPN, hackers and cyber
                  criminals can’t decipher this data.
               </p>
               <h4>Secure encryption:</h4>
               <p> To read the data, you need an encryption key . Without one, it would take millions of years for a
                  computer to decipher the code in the event of a brute force attack . With the help of a VPN, your
                  online activities are hidden even on public networks.</p>
               <h4> Disguising your whereabouts : </h4>
               <p>VPN servers essentially act as your proxies on the internet. Because the demographic location data
                  comes from a server in another country, your actual location cannot be determined. In addition, most
                  VPN services do not store logs of your activities. Some providers, on the other hand, record your
                  behavior, but do not pass this information on to third parties. This means that any potential record
                  of your user behavior remains permanently hidden.</p>
               <h4> Access to regional content:</h4>
               <p> Regional web content is not always accessible from everywhere. Services and websites often contain
                  content that can only be accessed from certain parts of the world. Standard connections use local
                  servers in the country to determine your location. This means that you cannot access content at home
                  while traveling, and you cannot access international content from home. With VPN location spoofing ,
                  you can switch to a server to another country and effectively “change” your location.</p>
               <h4> Secure data transfer:</h4>
               <p> If you work remotely, you may need to access important files on your company’s network. For security
                  reasons, this kind of information requires a secure connection. To gain access to the network, a VPN
                  connection is often required. VPN services connect to private servers and use encryption methods to
                  reduce the risk of data leakage.</p>

               <h4> Zero-knowledge, log free</h4>
               <p> We never keep any info about IP and traffic of our users</p>
